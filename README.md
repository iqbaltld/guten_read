# ðŸ“š Guten Read - Book Analysis with AI

A Flutter application that analyzes books from Project Gutenberg to extract and get character relationships using AI.

## Features

- **Book Download**: Fetch any public domain book from Project Gutenberg using its ID
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes Groq AI to analyze character relationships and interactions
- **Interactive Visualization**: View character networks and interactions
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows clean architecture principles for maintainability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK (compatible with your Flutter version)
- Groq API key (for AI analysis)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iqbaltld/guten_read.git
   cd guten_read
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your Groq API key:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```
   - **Important**: The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` for security. Never commit your API key to version control.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Dependencies

- **State Management**: `flutter_bloc` with `equatable`
- **Dependency Injection**: `get_it` with `injectable`
- **Networking**: `dio` for HTTP requests
- **UI**: `flutter_screenutil` for responsive design
- **Utilities**: 
  - `dartz` for functional programming
  - `intl` for internationalization
  - `url_launcher` for opening external links
  - `connectivity_plus` for network status
  - `flutter_dotenv` for environment variables

## How It Works

1. **Book Download**: The app fetches the full text of a book from Project Gutenberg using the provided book ID.
2. **Text Processing**: The book content is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
3. **AI Analysis**: The text is sent to the Groq AI service to analyze character relationships and interactions.
4. **Visualization**: Results are presented through a detailed character list.

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Enter a valid Project Gutenberg book ID (e.g., `1513`)
3. Tap "Analyze" to begin the download and analysis process
4. View the character network visualization
5. Explore detailed character relationships and interaction frequencies
